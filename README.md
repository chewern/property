# Section A: Introduction

This is a simple personal project created for the purpose of my own search for a Singapore private property. This program is created for the following reasons:
1.	I find it tedious to find and analyse property transaction data on URA website

2.	I needed more customized analysis to answer my own curiosities, such as whether how much more premium should higher floors command? Is condominium status always command better prices than apartment status?

3.	I want to keep a long term record of transactions because URA continuously purge the older data.

4.	Transaction data on popular private portals such as propertyguru and SRX are not complete.
